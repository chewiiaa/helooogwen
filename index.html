    <p><strong>To my baby, my sweetheart, my honeybunch sugarplum, my cupcake sa ibabaw ng icing ko, my motivation, my reason, my everything‚ÄîHappy Birthday!!</strong></p>

    <p>Years have already passed, but the feelings I‚Äôve felt for you are still the same. I still like you for your humorous jokes and your kind soul. I still like you for the way you are. You truly deserve to be loved‚Äîthat‚Äôs why I am trying to make you feel it.</p>

    <p>I don‚Äôt know if I truly deserve to have you‚Äîto be loved by you. After everything, how could you still love and forgive me? I am afraid that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to give you the love you truly deserve. I‚Äôm afraid that you‚Äôll meet someone who can give you everything without struggling. But I don‚Äôt have a choice, though. If I am not worthy enough‚Äîif even with simple words I cannot express myself, and I struggle‚Äîit is not your fault, it‚Äôs mine. And I will never blame you for it. I would still love you, even if you won‚Äôt choose me.</p>

    <p>You‚Äôve built a home in my heart, where laughter echoes through the expanding and contracting chambers‚Äîcreating a rhythmic pulse of joy.</p>

    <p>Thank you for being patient with me, especially on the days when I bottle everything up and say nothing. I want to stay through the storms, through the highs and lows, and through this chaotic world. You truly deserve a love that‚Äôs constant and unwavering.</p>

    <p>I have never felt this warmth before. Your laughter, your beauty‚Äîeverything about you‚Äîmakes it feel so unreal.</p>

    <p>I am so truly thankful to have you in my life. May this gift I‚Äôve made for you make your day, even though I am far away. May your life be filled with joy and laughter.</p>
